Blowups (refinement of fans)
pullbacks of divisors
pullbacks of sheaves
Debug existing code
Look in classical references (e.g. Cox Little Schenck) for the toric morphisms there (e.g. obvious examples)
isSemiProjective (support of the fan is convex?)
isProjective
isInjective
isSurjective (check this)
isFibration (check this)
isBirational
isBundle
Image of a subvariety 
Degree of the morphism
isSmooth
is(LocallyTrivial)FiberBundle
Induced map on the Chow ring
Images of cones
We need a bunch of test examples to check that the code is performing as it should, e.g.:
  Geometric quotients (inclusion of one lattice as a sublattice)

What other properties of morphisms between toric varieties?
Can we get at the fibers of a morphism?
